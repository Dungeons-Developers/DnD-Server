## Project Summary

Our plan for this project was to create a robust application that allows players to create, track, and maintain characters & campaigns in an online database. We want to put online many of the offline elements of D&D. Things like character creation, stat tracking, equipment tracking, campaign notes, campaign progress, and DM campaign variables are typically maintained with pen and paper. This tool, if fully realized, could help create an online database to track, analyze, and crowd-source aggregate player data.
